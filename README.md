## Challenge Description
We'd like you to write a library integrating with a hypothetical API. Depending on your experience, this project can take as little as 30 minutes but should take no more than a few hours to complete.

The API is a single endpoint, providing scoring advice about consumers based on their income, zip code, and age.

The hypothetical API is accessible via a standard HTTP GET request. For example:

```http://fake_scoring_service.com/customer_score?income=35000&zipcode=37756&age=33```

A successful request to the API will return a JSON response resembling the following:

```{ "propensity": 0.26532, "ranking": "C" }```

Your library should gracefully handle some common errors that you think might occur during its usage.
